Here are the changes I made in response to the feedback of practicals.

Practical5: 
I made up the part that was not printed and the pseudocode I missed. Besides, 
I improved the understanding of the code in mysterycode.py.
Practical6:
I added the title of the pie chart and successfully displayed the frequency 
table that I missed before. I also made up the missed pseudocode.

The feedback of practicals are useful and help me understand the standard more
clearly.
