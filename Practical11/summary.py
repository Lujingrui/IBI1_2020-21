interpretation: 
  Comparing these 3 protein sequences, we could find that the most similar 
protein sequences were from human and mouse proteins. This indicates that humans
and mice might evolved from a common ancestor. With natural selection, two 
species gradually formed and thus the differences in protein sequences are 
greater.
